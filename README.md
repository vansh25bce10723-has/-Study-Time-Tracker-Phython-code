Study Time Tracker

This is a small Python project where I made a simple Study Time Tracker. The main idea of this project is to keep a record of how long a student studies. Many times we think we study for long hours, but actually we don’t know the exact time. So this program helps in tracking it.

The user can start a study session, stop it and then the program will calculate how much time was spent. All sessions are stored and the user can check the report any time. When the user exits the program, it also saves the report in a text file called study_report.txt.

This project is made using only basic Python concepts like loops, lists, conditions, file handling and the time module. It is simple to understand and useful for students to manage their time better.

Conclusion

This project helped me understand how to use basic Python commands and how to store data in a file. It is a simple but practical project which can be used by anyone who wants to track their study time.
